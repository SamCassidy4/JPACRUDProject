# JPACRUDProject

## Description

The JPACRUDProject makes use of everything learned so far. I created a recipe database that makes use of MySQL workbench to store the data in a table. I simplified the database to just a few factors: the name, description, ingredients, cooking instructions, and for fun, a little history. Trying to find a recipe online is tedious and frustrating, sifting through food blog after food blog is tiresome, so I figured making a database that could store any recipe you could thing of would be beneficial. This is only a MVP, in the future I would like to expand to be able to search for a recipe using only the ingredients and for the user to be able to search for food by region. 

This project makes use of full stack development, the database stores the data through the use of MySQL, Java will communicate with the database through the use of java code, using methods and java objects as well as junit testing for the complete experience of developing a real world project. Lastly, the project makes use of web forms for an easy user experience. In this project, I have the user being able to look up a recipe using the ID of said ID, however, I recognize this is unrealistic when the database becomes much larger, later on this will be replaced by a keyword search and an ingredient search. On the webpage the users are able to click on whatever recipe they want to see to be able to see all the information they want, once they do they are prompted to return to home, edit the recipe, or delete the recipe. Once one of those is clicked and the respective information is filled out, the user is given a message that their request has been processed and the recipe is updated. Lastly, once the user returns to home they are able to create their own recipe which will be properly added to the database once all the proper information is filled out.

## Lessons Learned
I learned how far I've come since I first started coding in Java. This project was very big for me in terms of confidence. I learned how important it is to trust myself when it comes to the methods and logic I create. I learned exactly how controllers work and how the pathing of each level of the stack operates. I also learned how consistency is key when it comes to naming controller variables and form names, it saves a lot of time and a lot of headache in the long run. Lastly, I learned about how important the stack trace information can be, I combed through the stack trace to find all of the errors I had when creating this project.
